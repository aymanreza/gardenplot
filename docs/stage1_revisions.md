Comparing the SCAW_PT1-Stage 1 Revisions and ProjectProposal document, we changed the "Creative Component" section. 
Other than that, the rest of the information remains the same. This change was to address the comment:

  -1 Creative component: 
    Predicting the weather based on historical data for the same day doesn't sound feasible because it implies the weather 
    is partially determined by the date, so the creative component needs to be changed.
